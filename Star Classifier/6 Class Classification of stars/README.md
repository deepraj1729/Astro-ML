This is a Star Classifier Model (Iris Version) which uses a ML algorithm (Deep Neural Network) to classify stars based on several
features such as :

1. Surface Temperature (in K)
2. Luminosity (measured with respect to that of Sun)
3. Radius (measured with respect to that of Sun)
4. Absolute Magnitude (Visual) , Mv
5. Star Color
6. Spectral Class
7. Star Type (or Class)

The Star Type is what we need to predict after training a part of the dataset from 6 class csv.csv file.

The star Type includes :

Star Type     Corresponding Class

  0        ->   Brown Dwarf
  
  1        ->   Red Dwarf
  
  2        ->   White Dwarf
  
  3        ->   Main Sequence
  
  4        ->   Supergiant
  
  5        ->   Hyperginat
